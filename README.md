# Protein Density vs Protein Perception 🇮🇳

> **India is protein deficient — but more importantly, protein misinformed.**

This project uses data to challenge a common nutritional misconception:  
many foods widely perceived as “good protein sources” are actually **poor primary protein providers when evaluated on protein density** (protein per 100 calories).

The goal is not to label foods as *good* or *bad*, but to **separate nutritional role from nutritional efficiency**.

## 📌 Motivation

India faces a well-documented protein intake gap, yet dietary discussions often focus on *what contains protein* rather than *how efficiently protein is delivered*.

This project asks a simple but critical question:

> **How much protein do you really get for every 100 calories you consume?**

When protein density is used as the lens, popular assumptions begin to break down.

## 🧠 Core Idea

- **Protein content alone is misleading**
- **Protein density (protein per 100 kcal)** is a more practical metric
- Many staple foods require **excessive caloric intake** to deliver meaningful protein
- A smaller set of foods provide **high protein with relatively low calorie cost**

This distinction is crucial for:
- Protein adequacy
- Weight management
- Dietary planning at scale
